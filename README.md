## LineEncoder
Line Encoder and Scrambler for data encoding techniques using C++ and OpenGL
# [Project Report](Project%20Report.pdf)
# Objective
  - Implement Line coding encoder and scrambler with random digital data generator
  - Line coding schemes implemented: NRZ-L, NRZ-I, RZ, Manchester, Differential Manchester, AMI.
  - Scrambling schemes implemented: Block-Coding ,B8ZS ,HDB3.
# Assumptions
  - Random Functions have different probability options for changes of 0's and 1's.
  - Logic of each type is mentioned in the option itself.
  - The graph above shows Original Data and graph below shows Encoded Data.
  - Scrambling logic is working on AMI encoded form of Original Data
# Prerequisites
  - Language: C++ (c++17)
  - External Liberies used: GLFW,GLAD for implementing OpenGL
  - IDE:Visual Studio 2019
